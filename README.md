# node-js-Project
ilanDB server

#Description

This Node.js application leverages Express.js to establish a user management system with role-based access control (RBAC) and card functionalities. Users can register as normal users, business users, or admins, each with varying privileges.

#Features

##User Management:
User registration with role selection (normal, business, admin)
User authentication (login)
Role-based authorization for specific actions (e.g., admins can manage all cards, business users can manage their own cards, normal users can only view cards)
##Card Management:
Card creation (potentially with different card types for different user roles)
CRUD operations on cards (create, read, update, delete)
User-specific card access based on roles (e.g., normal users can only view public cards, business users can view their own cards and public cards, admins can view all cards)
Getting Started

##Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Ilan1992/node-js-Project.git

Replace https://github.com/Ilan1992/node-js-Project.git with the actual URL for your cloned repository.
Install Dependencies:
Bash
cd your-project-name
npm install

(or yarn install if you prefer using yarn)
Running the Application

##Start the Server:
Bash
npm start

(or yarn start) This will typically start the server on port 3000 (you can customize this in the code).
API Endpoints (Example)

Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy this application to various platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any cloud provider that supports Node.js.
Refer to their specific deployment instructions for setting up the environment and configuring your application.
Additional Notes

Remember to replace placeholders like your-project-name and your-username with your actual project details.
This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation will require writing the necessary code for user management, authentication, authorization, card creation/management, database interactions (if applicable), and API endpoints.
Consider using a secure database solution like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user and card data.
