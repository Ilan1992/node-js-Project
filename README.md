# node-js-Project
ilanDB server

# Description

This Node.js application leverages Express.js to establish a user management system with role-based access control (RBAC) and card functionalities. Users can register as normal users, business users, or admins, each with varying privileges.

# Features

## User Management:
User registration with role selection (normal, business, admin)
User authentication (login)
Role-based authorization for specific actions (e.g., admins can manage all cards, business users can manage their own cards, normal users can only view cards)
## Card Management:
Card creation (potentially with different card types for different user roles)
CRUD operations on cards (create, read, update, delete)
User-specific card access based on roles (e.g., normal users can only view public cards, business users can view their own cards and public cards, admins can view all cards)
